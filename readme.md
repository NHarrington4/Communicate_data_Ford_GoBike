# Ford GoBike System
## by Nancy Harrington


## Dataset

>  The Ford GoBike system is a regional public bike sharing system in the San Francisco Bay area.  It began it's operation in 2013 with 700 bicycles and 70 stations. It changed names from Bay Area Bike Share to the Ford GoBike in the summer of 2017 and has since changed names again to Bay Wheels. It now has over 2,600 bicycles and 262 stations and is projected to expand to over 7,000 bicycles and 540 stations in the San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose areas.

## Summary of Findings


> After assessing the data and some cleaning I started to explore the Ford GoBike data. I started off with univariate charts just to wrap my head around the numbers and data to see if anything interesting presented it's self. I started off looking at monthly, weekly, and time of day usage. Then went to the most popular start and end stations and the number of customers and subscribers.  I moved to looking at bivariate data with trip duration being my most popular variable against the monthly, weekly and hourly variables. I looked at the number of trips of subscribers vs. customers and added those variables to monthly, weekly, hourly, and start and end stations. To finish off my explatory findings I found my self looking at trip duration, user type and the monthly weekly and hourly variables most facinating and those were ones I chose to bring into my explanatory analysis. 


## Key Insights for Presentation


> Trip durations and user type were the constant variables I ended up using the most and adding in the monthly, weekly, or hourly variables.  I did make my graphs bigger for better visualiation and made sure they all had labels and were easily intereptable.
